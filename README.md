# functional-ear-training

We aim to build a open source version of [Alain Benbassat method](http://www.miles.be/software) of ear training. Also [this Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kaizen9.fet.android) implements his method.

We aim to be using [Kivy](https://kivy.org) and focus in portability; is a simple app, so, no excuses to keep it portable.

## other notes

Would be great if someone could write this to a webapp too. Maybe later..
